## About
Lab 1 - Triangle Intersection with Mouse Ray

A mouse ray and the 3D intersection point with the pyramid. Draw a little sphere at the point of interesection. The code should work from any camera position and on any triangle of the pyramid. 

## Notes
**ofApp.cpp**<br>
* setup = initialization; called once
* draw = default 60Hz drawn every frame
* update = change overtime
  * ex: animation
* overload mousePressed, mouseDragged to print out values of the details or state of the mesh

### TO-DO:<br>
**Maya**<br>
* Use Revolve.
  * Surface -> Revolve
* Default usually not a polygon, go not do nurbs
* Press space bar = 4 view window
* Curves/Surfaces do Bezier

* Mesh -> Smooth
* Division levels: 2
* To Triangulate -> make triangles
